                     <h4>Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that usually cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold. However, certain types of coronavirus can infect the lower airway, causing serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis. Most people get infected with coronaviruses at some point in their lives and the majority of these infections are harmless.

                <p>COVID-19 is a newly identified respiratory virus 
                    that can easily spread. It shares several symptoms
                     with influenza, but it’s treated differently.
                      COVID-19 infection may appear two to 14 days 
                      after exposure and can include fever, cough and
                       shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</p>
                 <h3>What to do</h3>  
                 <p>If you’re showing any sign of possible COVID-19 symptoms, please contact your local health care provider. Your provider or a nurse will direct you to our dedicated COVID-19 Nurse Line. If you meet testing criteria, you’ll be directed to one of our local testing sites.

                    Keep yourself healthy — wash your hands, avoid touching your face, distance yourself from others and practice appropriate self-care, including staying home when you’re sick. We also recommend you have a personal care plan in place in case you or a family member is directly affected by the virus.</p>  
                  <h3>What NOT to do</h3>
                  
                  <p>This virus rapidly spreads. Help us minimize potential exposure to other patients by NOT coming into a clinic or hospital to be tested. Please call your local provider first to find out how to be evaluated.</p>
